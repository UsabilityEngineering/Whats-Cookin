# Usability Evaluation
## Group
Bryant Hoang, Gabriel Rachert, Ryan Lehmer

## Summary
We have discovered that many users easily achieve tasks set by the interview with minimal wasted clicks and was straight forward in the way to accomplish a task. Users seem less drawn to the idea of using the wizard to start choosing allergy and would tend to go directy to search for recipes. Users also tended to be drawn to the more prominent images of popular dishes and allergies as to try them out or directly to the answer to their task with popular dishes.

## Background Information
We ask the participants to think back to how they found her most recent recipe. This is a very important question because it gives us insight into how they found their last recipe. Asking for their thoughts on their last recipe service they can give us inspiration in what aspects we can improve on in our own application.

## Task 1

In this task we ask the user to find a recipe that doesn't contain nuts and is cheap per serving. The goal of this question is to see how a user interacts with the allergen filter and tasks them with being able to find the cost rating. This gives us an understanding of if our layout of  the website is easy to follow. Since the allergy filter was a major design aspect we wanted to make sure that it was simple and easy to use. Asking the user to find a cheap recipe was also key in understanding if we had the right information in the right spot. Finally we ask the user on their rating of difficulty of this task and why. This is to give us further insight into their thinking, although we did ask them to think out loud during the task. Asking them directly gives us a direct response to why they liked or disliked the task.

## Task 2

In this task we ask the user to invite a couple of friends over to cook an expensive meal together. This task is trying to figure out how easy it is for a first time user to invite friends, which is another key aspect of our design. We also ask if they can once again sort by price to make sure it's easy to locate the price of a meal. After the task we ask to rate the difficulty and why once again giving us further insight  on their thinking.

## Wrap Up

We ask the user a few more direct questions to get more understanding of certain aspects. We ask what they liked most about the product to see if our key design aspects were understood. Asking what they disliked most about the product is key as well so we know if there are any trending topics to improve. Also asking their thoughts on any additional features allows us to expand the product directly based on user feedback. We then ask the user for feedback on 3 major design features, making sure that these features are working properly and adding the value that we hoped they would add.

## Overall approach

For our approach to this project, we went with the formative approach, although it was towards the end of development so it was close to a summative approach. We used the think-aloud method so that we could get an idea of the thought process of our tested users as they were going through their tasks. 

## Results

We discovered that the format and style of the page needed to be more prominent, especially the hamburger helper. As well as being shown some form of removing allergies if a user added one by mistake. They would also like for there to be symbols on the recipes for quick scanning of the recipe to see if they meet other allergy conditions. As well as making recipes and posting them on the website as well as sharing websites on social media. Also the ability to view what recipes friends have cooked recently.
