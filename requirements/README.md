# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Group
Bryant Hoang, Gabriel Rachert, Ryan Lehmer

## Functional Requirements
-Who your users are
  -Users who are interested in cooking as well as having a good time with friends and family by sharing ingredients and making a nice meal.
-Why might they need a new solution to a problem?
  -Our solution not only allows people to find recipes with what they have but we have a large focus on friends. Our app focuses on the social aspects of cooking and attempts to bring people together over food.
-What are their priorities
  -To save money and time while making decent food. 
-What are their mental models
  -A website that allows us to pick a recipe and ask other friends and family to share ingredients and spend time together. 
-How would/should they accomplish their goals with your software
  -They should be able to search for a type of dish or a dish that is centered around one main ingredient that then allows them to add smaller customizations to cut down their search results.
  
##Requirements
-Students would like some way of filtering recipes by health.
-Students prioritize cooking at home potentially to save money on food.
-Students are money conscious. A way to show savings or cost per serving would be beneficial.

## Methods | Describe (A) Methods you used (B) Why you used them, and (C) Number of users (e.g. n=10) for each method
A. Questionnaire
B. To gather a significant quantity of data
C. n=9

## Findings
We got responses from 9 people ranging from 20-40. We found that the majority of people didn't find it hard to cook, but nor was it something they found easy. However the majority of people also cooked at home fairly often. Though in how much time they made for themselves to cook, it was pretty split across the likhert scale. The majority of our respondees spent some or a decent amount of time with friends. Nobody was looking for only healthy recipies, but the responses were almost evenly split among the rest of the options on the likhert scale. It was split down the middle of whether or not they enjoyed watching food videos, but most of the respondees don't use any cooking apps or websites currently to augment their cooking. 7/9 of the respondees were saying that they were trying to save money when cooking. 

## Conclusions
-Based on the data gathered on whether or not our users find it difficult to cook we found that users are neutral. So having a difficulty rating per recipe would benefit users' decisions. 

## Caveats
Most of the respondents were younger college age students and that is a demographic that is more predisposed to having less money.
