# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

* Surveys received **(n=9)** from **students**.
* Most students reported that **they use** some sort of cooking technology
  * Only allowed yes or no answers **~80%** responded **yes**
* Most students responded **that they would** want to save money when it comes to cooking 
  * Only allowed yes or no answers **~80%** responded **yes**
* Students mainly agreed on finding **some difficulty in cooking**.
  * On a 5 point scale 5 of the 9 where **neutral**
* 5 of the 9 students responded that they **almost always** cook at home
* **Half** of the students found trouble in making time to cook
* **Most** of the students spend time with their friends
  * Of the **9 responses all but one** said they spend some time with friends.  
* **All but 2** students stated that they **would want something other than healthy recipes**

We identified a few requirements
  * Students would like **some way of filtering** recipes **by health**.
  * Students **prioritize cooking at home** potentially to save money on food.
  * Students are **money conscious**. A way to **show savings or cost per serving** would be beneficial.
